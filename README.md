# Css-Grid-Practice

 I came across a really cool photo posted by Bloombergbusiness on instagram and instantly had a feeling that I need to copy it. You can see the image below to your left and you can see my copy of it to the right. I used some cool dog pictures and created the gallery using HTML and CSS. I used a little bit of JS for something I could have done with CSS, but I wanted to challenge myself, as I am slowly picking up JS.

    <img src = 'result/IMG_6117.PNG' alt = 'Instagram Photo' >
